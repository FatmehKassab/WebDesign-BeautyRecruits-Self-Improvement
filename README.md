Title: Beauty Recruits Web Design Project

Description:
This web design project for Beauty Recruits, where I applied various techniques and skills to create a responsive and visually appealing website. 
Leveraging flexbox techniques, responsiveness principles, and a touch of JavaScript, I aimed to deliver a user-friendly experience while maintaining a professional architectural structure(Assets> Images, Styles, Scripts) and naming the pages effectively for maintaining a well-organized and easily navigable web project. 

Key Features:
1. Flexbox Layout
2. Responsiveness
3. JavaScript 
4. Professional Architecture
